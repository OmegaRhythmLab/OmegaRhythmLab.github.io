Welcome to the Omega Website at OmegaRhythmLab.github.io, built by 起个名真难 and MFn.

There are some important things to know about the project:

* There is a file in the "Js" folder called "file.py" that can be run to fix the data in "order.js".

* The project "OmegaNewsCreator" has been uploaded to https://github.com/Wang210106/NewsCreator.

* We will be working on fixing any bugs in the project in the near future.

Please note that there are still some unfinished aspects of the project. We will try to complete them in our spare time.
